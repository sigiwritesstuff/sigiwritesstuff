# About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a C library combining what I learned following the audio programming book(Richard Boulanger
  and Victor Lazzarini) with my own interests in integrating different choices of tuning systems into software. The library
  takes breakpoint files with each row corresponding to one note in a score and generates audio samples to write to audio,
  after initialisation with the selected tuning system/envelope/wavetable functions.
  
- ðŸŒ± As a self taught programmer with several years of experience which trailed off, I'm focused on learning about the tools,
  processes and so on which my academic background didn't give me. I also want to branch out to a number of specialties from
  my audio background(eg more complex speaker setups, realtime audio demands, file formats etc) plus more languages.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on basically anything, the main things which interest me are projects involving more maths/logic
  even outside of audio.
  
- ðŸ¤” If you have help to offer I'm up for anything. Hopefully my work will be interesting for the ideas even while building
  experience.
