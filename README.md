# About me

- Interests in music psychology and tuning systems for electronic music, algorithmic design, graphics programming and OOP.

- Developing programming skills and knowledge of computer science from a postgraduate mathematics/electronic engineering
  background and self-studying to understand more fundamental aspects.
  
- C/C++ programmer familiar with procedural and OOP paradigms, can also use python/java/basic shell scripting and regex.

- Current project in C++ using OpenGL to model Keplerian orbits in the solar system of major planets and satellites with
  camera modes for viewing each two-body system in more detail.

- Learning about programming language grammars and graphics hardware on the side.

- Interested in contributing mathematics knowledge to other projects involving graphics and audio devices, while learning
  from experience and getting to work with more knowledgeable developers. I am someone who learns through reading both
  textbooks and online resources(including documentation and manuals) so can adapt to new fields if required.
